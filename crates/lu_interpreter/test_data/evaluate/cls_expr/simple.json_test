Calling closures which were defined in scope works
===
fn func_1
    let cls_ = cls ret 1 end
    ret cls_
end
func_1
---
{
  "Ok": {
    "Number": 1.0
  }
}
...
Returning closure and then calling it works
===
fn func_1
    ret cls ret 1 end
end
let cls_ = func_1
cls_
---
{
  "Ok": {
    "Number": 1.0
  }
}
...
Passing closure to HOF works
===
use std:iter
[ 1 2 3 ] | filter cls(arg) ret $arg > 1 end
---
{
  "Ok": {
    "Array": [
      {
        "Number": 2.0
      },
      {
        "Number": 3.0
      }
    ]
  }
}
...
