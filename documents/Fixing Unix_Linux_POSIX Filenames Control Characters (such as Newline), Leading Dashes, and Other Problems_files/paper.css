/* Automatic numbering has been in CSS since 1998, but
   Internet Explorer and Mozilla have not supported it.
   Firefox 1.5 supports them, so now finally it's reasonable to enable in 2006.
   DO NOT place constant numbering in essays - let the browser do it!

   Note: Older versions of Firefox followed a draft of CSS 2.1, not CSS 2.
   Details here:

  Things changed since.  The following now works.

  /* Indent paragraphs.
     I'd like to use the P property "text-indent", but this
     is not correctly implemented some versions of Internet Explorer
     and Mozilla. So, we'll use this workaround. Unfortunately, this
     workaround makes Safari offset the whole line, not wrapping it
     correctly; Loup Vaillant has reported this as bug March 2009.
     If anyone has suggestions for what to do instead, please let me know.
